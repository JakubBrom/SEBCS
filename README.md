# SEBCS for QGIS - Module for calculation of energy balance features and vegetation water stress indices

## Description

The SEBCS for QGIS is software enabling calculation of energy balance and crop water stress features (heat fluxes, evaporative fraction, Bowen ratio, Omega factor, CWSI etc.) from Landsat satellite data (L5 TM, L7 ETM+, L8 and L9 OLI/TIRS) and also from other devices (e.g. UAV). Calculation procedure uses approach based on Penman-Monteith method, SEBAL method and gradient approach of the energy balance characteristics calculation.

## Install

SEBCS for QGIS is distributed within QGIS Plugin repository. If you need to install SEBCS for QGIS from GitHub press green "Code" button and download the SEBCS for QGIS in zip format. Install it as a plug-in in QGIS - go to Plugins/Manage and Install Plugins/Install from ZIP.
