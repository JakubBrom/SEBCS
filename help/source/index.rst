SEBCS's documentation!
======================

Introduction
------------

The SEBCS for QGIS is software enabling calculation of energy balance and crop water stress features (heat fluxes, evaporative fraction, Bowen ratio, Omega factor, CWSI etc.) from Landsat satellite data (L5 TM, L7 ETM+, L8 OLI/TIRS, L9 OLI/TIRS) and also from other devices (e.g. UAV).
The calculation procedure uses an approach based on Penman-Monteith method, SEBAL method and gradient approach of the energy balance characteristics calculation.
